Enum Type: `Endian`

# Enum `Endian`

Two categories of endiannesses are defined in enum [`Endian`].

1. Relative Endiannesses
    - Native-Endianness
      (denoted as [`Endian::Native`], or [`NE`] for short)
    - Swapped-Endianness
      (denoted as [`Endian::Swapped`], or [`SE`] for short)

2. Absolute Endiannesses
    - Little-Endianness
      (denoted as [`Endian::Little`], or [`LE`] for short)
    - Big-Endianness
      (denoted as [`Endian::Big`], or [`BE`] for short)

The main purpose of enum [`Endian`] is to specify the endianness of a
byte representation of a type.

Fore more information, see the document of enum [`Endian`].
